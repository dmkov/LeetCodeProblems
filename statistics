Solved:

May 2019:
26 - 53, 26, 122
27 - 443, 204
28 - 350, 11, 345
29 - 374
30 - 100

Done with help:
204 - did not pass timeout (non efficient solution with hashmap)
11 - did not find the best solution (n^2 instead of n)

Done by myself but need attention:
122 - did mistake in calculations
374 - while condition should be inclusive - while (min <= max) - in case of array with one element
100 - recursion check is more simple and efficient than migration to the array
