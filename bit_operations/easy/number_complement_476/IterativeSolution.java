/**
 476. Number Complement
 https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Example 1:
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 Example 2:
 Input: 1
 Output: 0
 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

 Note:
 The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

 1. Complexity
    1.1 Time Complexity is O(1)
    1.2 Space Complexity is O(1)
 2. Approach
    2.1 Find the most significant '1' bit and then revert bits starting of it to the end
