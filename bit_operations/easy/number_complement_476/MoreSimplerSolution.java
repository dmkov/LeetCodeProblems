/**
 476. Number Complement
 https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Example 1:
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 Example 2:
 Input: 1
 Output: 0
 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

 Note:
 The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

 --------

 1. Complexity
    1.1 Time Complexity is O(1)
    1.2 Space Complexity is O(1)
 2. Approach
    2.1 Shift copy of number until it reaches 0. Meantime, reverse original number bit by bit.
